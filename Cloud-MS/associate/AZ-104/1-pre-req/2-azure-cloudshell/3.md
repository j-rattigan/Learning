#  3 - How does Azure CS work

## üéØ Goal:
Understand how Azure Cloud Shell functions, including its environment setup, resource access, and session management.

## üß† 1. Break it Down

### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- **Cloud Shell Environment**: Runs in the browser, providing a command-line interface without needing to install anything locally.
- **Persistent Storage**: Each session has access to 5 GB of persistent cloud storage to save scripts and configurations.
- **Preconfigured Tools**: Includes pre-installed tools like Azure CLI, PowerShell, Git, and more, which can be used right away without installation.
- **Integrated Authentication**: Automatically authenticated using your Azure account, allowing you to manage resources without additional login steps.

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key Features**
- **Web-based Interface**: Accessible from any device with an internet browser; you don‚Äôt need to install anything locally.
- **Automatic Resource Setup**: Each session has its environment and tools set up automatically, making it easy to start working without extra configuration.
- **Session Persistence**: While your shell session can be closed, the files and configurations you store in Cloud Shell persist across sessions.
- **Integration with Azure Resources**: Directly connected to your Azure account, allowing you to manage and interact with your cloud resources seamlessly.

### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **Custom Shell Environment**: Azure Cloud Shell provides a ready-to-use shell environment that includes both a command-line interface and a scripting environment.
- **Multiple Sessions**: You can create multiple Cloud Shell sessions to interact with different parts of your Azure resources simultaneously.
- **Security Features**: Azure Cloud Shell is secured with Azure Active Directory (AAD), ensuring that all access and commands are properly authenticated.
- **Shared Storage**: The 5 GB of persistent storage is accessible across all Cloud Shell sessions, making it easy to keep important files accessible at all times.

## üîç 2. Summary
Azure Cloud Shell works by providing a preconfigured, persistent cloud environment for managing Azure resources directly from a browser, with built-in tools and security features.

## üî• 3. Analogy
Think of Azure Cloud Shell as a cloud-based workspace, where you walk in, find all your tools set up and ready to go, and can start working on your tasks without needing to unpack or set anything up.
