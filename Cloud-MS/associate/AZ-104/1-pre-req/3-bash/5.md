# Summary
In this module, you learned the basics of using Bash. Among other things, you:

- Learned what a shell is and what Bash is
- Learned how Bash commands are structured
- Learned key Bash commands, such as `ls`, `cat`, and `ps`
- Learned how to use I/O operators in Bash commands to redirect input and output
- Learned how to find and terminate rogue processes
- Learned how to use Bash to filter output from another CLI tool

**Takeaway**: There's more you can do with Bash. We've gotten comfortable using Bash as a way to interact with our shell, but you can use the commands you learned (and many more) to use Bash for full-fledged programming.
