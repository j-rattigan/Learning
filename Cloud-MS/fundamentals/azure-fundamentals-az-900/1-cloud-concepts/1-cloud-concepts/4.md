## **Cloud Model Breakdown**  

| **Cloud Model** | ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important** | ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Supporting Details** | ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Examples/ Facts** |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Private Cloud** | ðŸ”¹ Used by a single entity (organization, company). <br> ðŸ”¹ Offers greater control over IT services, but comes with higher costs. | ðŸ”¹ A cloud dedicated to a single company or entity. <br> ðŸ”¹ More expensive than public clouds due to dedicated resources. | ðŸ”¹ Can be hosted in your own data center or a dedicated third-party data center. |
| **Public Cloud** | ðŸ”¹ Managed by a third-party provider and available for anyone to use. | ðŸ”¹ Public availability: The key difference between public and private clouds. | ðŸ”¹ Public clouds offer scalable resources for anyone who wants to buy cloud services. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | ðŸ”¹ Integrates both private and public clouds, providing flexibility and security. | ðŸ”¹ Hybrid cloud: Combines private and public clouds for a flexible environment. <br> ðŸ”¹ Extra security: Users decide what services to keep private and which to place in the public cloud. | ðŸ”¹ If there's increased demand for a temporary period, a private cloud can surge by using public cloud resources. |
| **Multi-cloud** | ðŸ”¹ Uses multiple public cloud providers. | ðŸ”¹ Managing cloud resources from two or more providers simultaneously. | ðŸ”¹ A company might use AWS for storage and Azure for computing resources. |
