# **Responsibility Breakdown by Cloud Service Type**  
The division of responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer depends on the cloud service model being used.

| **Cloud Responsibility Breakdown** | ðŸ”¹ **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The cloud provider offers the basic infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, storage, networking). The consumer manages the OS, applications, and data. <br> ðŸ”¹ **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: The cloud provider provides both infrastructure and platform. The consumer only manages applications and data. <br> ðŸ”¹ **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The cloud provider manages everything. The consumer simply uses the software. | ðŸ”¹ **IaaS**: You are responsible for the operating system, applications, and data. <br> ðŸ”¹ **PaaS**: You are responsible for applications and data. <br> ðŸ”¹ **SaaS**: You only use the software; the cloud provider takes care of everything else. |

## **Cloud Service Model Examples**  

| **Cloud Model** | ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Examples/ Facts** |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **IaaS** | ðŸ”¹ Consumer manages the OS (Operating System), applications, and data. <br> ðŸ”¹ Cloud provider only manages the physical infrastructure and network. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Example**: Virtual Machines (VMs) running on a cloud providerâ€™s infrastructure. The consumer installs and manages everything from the OS up. |
| **PaaS** | ðŸ”¹ Consumer is responsible for deploying applications and managing data. <br> ðŸ”¹ Cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure and platform. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Example**: Using Azure App Services to deploy applications. You only manage the app, while the provider handles networking and storage. |
| **SaaS** | ðŸ”¹ Consumer only uses the software provided by the cloud provider. <br> ðŸ”¹ Cloud provider manages everything (infrastructure, platform, updates, security). <br> ðŸ”¹ **Example**: Using Microsoft Teams for collaboration. You donâ€™t manage any infrastructure or software updates â€“ the provider does. |

## **Responsibility Summary**  

| Cloud Model | Consumer's Responsibility | Provider's Responsibility |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **IaaS** | OS, applications, data | Physical infrastructure, network |
| **PaaS** | Applications, data | Infrastructure, platform |
| **SaaS** | Just uses the application | Everything else |
