# **Consumption-Based Model**  
The consumption-based model in cloud computing follows an **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** approach, allowing businesses to pay only for the resources they use, rather than making large upfront investments.

|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **CapEx vs. OpEx** | ðŸ”¹ **CapEx**: One-time expenditure to secure tangible resources (e.g., buying equipment, building a datacenter). <br> ðŸ”¹ **OpEx**: Ongoing spending for services or products (e.g., renting a convention center, cloud services). | ðŸ”¹ **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: Upfront costs for physical assets. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Ongoing costs for using services/products over time. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Computing**: A pay-as-you-go model based on OpEx, where you only pay for the IT resources you use. | ðŸ”¹ **Traditional Datacenter Risks**: Overestimating resources leads to wasted money, while underestimating causes capacity issues. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Model**: Scales up or down quickly, avoiding wasted resources. |

![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Examples/ Facts**
- **No upfront costs**â€”You donâ€™t need to purchase expensive infrastructure.
- **No need to manage infrastructure**â€”The cloud provider maintains it for you.
- **Scalability**â€”You can scale up or down based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**â€”You only pay for what you use.

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Pay-as-you-go Model** | ðŸ”¹ Rent resources as needed (e.g., CPU, storage). <br> ðŸ”¹ No maintenance of infrastructure required. <br> ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™re billed only for what you use. |
| **Cloud Provider's Role** | ðŸ”¹ Maintains underlying infrastructure while you only pay for usage. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Efficiency**â€”Run infrastructure without heavy upfront costs. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Scalability**â€”Easily scale with changing business needs. |
