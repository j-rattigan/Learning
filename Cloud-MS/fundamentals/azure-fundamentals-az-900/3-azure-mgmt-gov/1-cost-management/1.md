# Factors That Can Affect Costs in Azure

## ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
Azure shifts costs from **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** to **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**, meaning you pay for what you use instead of investing upfront. Several factors impact OpEx costs:

- **Resource Type**: Different resources have different costs based on type, settings, and region.
- **Consumption**: Pay-as-you-go pricing or reserved capacity discounts.
- **Maintenance**: Unused resources may still generate costs.
- **Geography**: Location affects costs due to regional pricing variations.
- **Subscription Type**: Some plans offer free or discounted usage.
- **Azure Marketplace**: Third-party services may have extra costs.
