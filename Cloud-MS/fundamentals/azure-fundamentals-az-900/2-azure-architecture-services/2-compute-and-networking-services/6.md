| **Azure Virtual Networks**            | Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources to communicate with each other, users on the internet, and your on-premises resources. Think of it as an extension of your on-premises network. | ðŸ”¹ **Virtual Network (VNet)**: A private network in Azure that provides isolation, segmentation, and secure communication between resources. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Subnets**: Smaller address spaces within a VNet that help organize and secure resources. | ðŸ”¹ **VNet** enables secure communication between resources, including VMs, web apps, and databases. <br> ðŸ”¹ Key capabilities include routing traffic, filtering traffic, and connecting virtual networks. |
| **Key Networking Capabilities of Azure Virtual Networks** | ðŸ”¹ **Isolation & Segmentation**: Create isolated networks within Azure. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Internet Communications**: Enable external communication via public IP addresses. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Internal Communication**: Enable secure communication between Azure resources. | ðŸ”¹ **Public Endpoints**: Accessible from anywhere with a public IP. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Private Endpoints**: Only accessible within a VNet with a private IP. | ðŸ”¹ **Isolation & Segmentation**: Define private IP address space; not internet routable. Can segment into subnets. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Internet Communications**: Use public IP or load balancer for inbound internet connections. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Communicate Between Resources**: VMs, App Services, and Kubernetes can all communicate through VNets. <br> ðŸ”¹ Use Service Endpoints to connect resources like Azure SQL Database and storage accounts to VNets for enhanced security. |
| **How to Connect On-Premises to Azure** | Azure allows you to create a hybrid network with your on-premises environment. | ðŸ”¹ **Point-to-Site VPN**: Secure connection from a single computer to Azure VNet. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects on-premises VPN device to Azureâ€™s VPN gateway. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Azure ExpressRoute**: Dedicated private connection to Azure, bypassing the internet. | ðŸ”¹ **ExpressRoute** is used for higher bandwidth and better security. <br> ðŸ”¹ VPN connections help link local and cloud environments, providing seamless connectivity. |
| **Routing and Filtering Network Traffic** | Azure allows for traffic management between subnets and between on-premises and Azure. | ðŸ”¹ **Route Tables**: Rules for how traffic is directed between subnets. <br> ðŸ”¹ **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Propagates on-premises routes to Azure virtual networks. <br> ðŸ”¹ **NSGs (Network Security Groups)**: Inbound and outbound security rules for controlling traffic. | ðŸ”¹ **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** allow you to create custom rules to allow/block traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs)** function as firewalls or optimize WAN. |
| **Summary of Azure Virtual Networking** | Azure Virtual Networks provide secure and scalable networking capabilities to connect resources both within Azure and with on-premises systems, enabling full control over traffic routing, security, and communication. | ðŸ”¹ **Virtual Network Peering**: Allows direct, private communication between virtual networks. Traffic travels over Microsoft's backbone network and not the public internet. <br> ðŸ”¹ **User-Defined Routes (UDR)**: Give you more control over traffic flow between subnets or VNets. | |
