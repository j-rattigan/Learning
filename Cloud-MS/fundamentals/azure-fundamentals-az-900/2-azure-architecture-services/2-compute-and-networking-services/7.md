| **Azure VPN Overview**                | A VPN uses an encrypted tunnel within another network, typically the public internet. It connects trusted private networks securely over an untrusted network to safely share sensitive information. | ðŸ”¹ **VPN Gateway**: A virtual network gateway deployed in a dedicated subnet that enables connectivity between on-premises data centers, devices, and virtual networks. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Preshared Key**: A shared secret used for authentication in both policy-based and route-based VPNs. | ðŸ”¹ VPNs are typically used to encrypt traffic to prevent eavesdropping. <br> ðŸ”¹ There are two types of VPNs in Azure: policy-based and route-based. |
| **VPN Gateway Connectivity**          | ðŸ”¹ **Site-to-Site**: Connects on-premises datacenters to virtual networks. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Point-to-Site**: Connects individual devices to virtual networks. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Network-to-Network**: Connects virtual networks to each other. | ðŸ”¹ **Active/Standby**: A configuration where one VPN instance is active, and another is on standby. When disruptions happen, the standby instance takes over. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Active/Active**: A configuration where both instances are active and provide redundancy with separate IPs. | ðŸ”¹ **Active/Standby** provides automatic failover without user intervention. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Active/Active** supports BGP routing protocol and offers better availability. |
| **High-Availability VPN Configurations** | ðŸ”¹ **Active/Standby**: One active gateway and one standby for automatic failover. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Active/Active**: Multiple active gateways, allowing for redundancy and better availability. | ðŸ”¹ **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Used in active/active VPN gateways to provide dynamic routing. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Zone-redundant gateways**: Gateways deployed across different Azure availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. | ðŸ”¹ **ExpressRoute failover**: In case of ExpressRoute issues, a VPN gateway can serve as a backup using the internet to ensure continuous connectivity. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Zone-redundant gateways**: In availability zones, VPN and ExpressRoute gateways are deployed in multiple zones for resiliency and scalability. |
