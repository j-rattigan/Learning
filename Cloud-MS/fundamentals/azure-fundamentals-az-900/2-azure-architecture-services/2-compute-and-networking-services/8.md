| **Azure ExpressRoute Overview**         | Azure ExpressRoute allows you to extend your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud via a private connection with a provider. This connection is called an ExpressRoute Circuit. It provides a faster, more reliable, and secure connection compared to the public internet. | ðŸ”¹ **ExpressRoute Circuit**: A private connection used to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Connectivity Provider**: The service that facilitates the private connection for ExpressRoute. | ðŸ”¹ **Connectivity Options**: <br> Any-to-any IP VPN <br> Point-to-point Ethernet Network <br> Virtual Cross-Connection <br> These options allow secure, fast connections without using the public internet. |
| **Benefits of ExpressRoute**            | Direct Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services, including: <br> ðŸ”¹ Microsoft Office 365 <br> ðŸ”¹ Microsoft Dynamics 365 <br> ðŸ”¹ Azure Virtual Machines <br> ðŸ”¹ Azure Storage & Cosmos DB | ðŸ”¹ **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Used to exchange routing information between on-premises networks and Azure services. <br> ðŸ”¹ **ExpressRoute Global Reach**: Enables data exchange across different on-premises locations without using the public internet. | ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Routing**: ExpressRoute uses BGP for dynamic routing, which adapts to network changes automatically. <br> ðŸ”¹ If you have an office in Asia and a datacenter in Europe, you can connect them with ExpressRoute Global Reach to avoid using the public internet. |
| **ExpressRoute Connectivity Models**    | ðŸ”¹ **CloudExchange Colocation**: Your facility is physically colocated at a cloud exchange, where you request a virtual cross-connect to Microsoft cloud. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Point-to-Point Ethernet**: Direct connection from your facility to Microsoft cloud. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Any-to-Any Networks**: Integrates your wide area network (WAN) with Azure. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Directly from ExpressRoute Sites**: High-speed connection directly to Microsoftâ€™s global network. | ðŸ”¹ **Colocation**: Physically placing your facility at a cloud exchange to facilitate a secure connection to the Microsoft cloud. <br> ðŸ”¹ **ExpressRoute Direct**: Provides dual high-speed connections to Microsoftâ€™s global network, supporting Active/Active connectivity. | ðŸ”¹ **Security Considerations**: Since ExpressRoute doesnâ€™t travel over the internet, itâ€™s more secure. However, DNS queries, certificate revocation list checks, and some Azure CDN requests will still be transmitted over the public internet. <br> ðŸ”¹ This separation ensures sensitive data remains private, while other data still benefits from the global Microsoft infrastructure. |
