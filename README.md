## ADHD-Friendly Learning Approach

As someone with ADHD, I’ve developed a learning style that caters to my needs for shorter, focused study sessions and hands-on activities. Here's how I approach my learning:

- **Bite-Sized Learning**: I break down complex topics into small, manageable sections. This helps maintain focus and keeps me engaged.
- **Active Engagement**: Instead of passive learning, I work on practical labs, projects, and hands-on exercises.
- **Variety in Learning**: I switch between different formats—videos, articles, courses—to keep things interesting and fresh.
- **Frequent Breaks**: I use the Pomodoro technique or similar methods to manage attention and avoid burnout.
  
These strategies help me absorb complex concepts and stay motivated throughout my learning journey.
