# Comparing Azure Pricing and TCO Calculators

## ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
Azure provides two key calculators to estimate and compare costs:  

1. **Pricing Calculator** – Estimates costs for provisioning Azure resources.  
2. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator** – Compares on-premises vs. Azure infrastructure costs.  

Each tool serves a different purpose, and understanding both helps in planning Azure expenses effectively.
