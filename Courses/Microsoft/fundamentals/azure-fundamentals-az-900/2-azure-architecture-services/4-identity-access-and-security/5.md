# **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  

Azure **RBAC** is a system that **manages permissions** to **control who can access what** in your cloud environment.

## **Why is Azure RBAC Important?**  

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**  
ðŸ”¹ **Follows the Principle of Least Privilege** â€“ Users should only have the **minimum access** needed to complete their tasks.  
ðŸ”¹ **Prevents Over-Permissioning** â€“ Example: If a user only needs **read access** to a **storage blob**, they **shouldnâ€™t** get **write access**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Simplifies Permission Management** â€“ Instead of assigning permissions **one by one**, Azure RBAC allows you to **assign roles to groups**.

## **How Azure RBAC Works**  

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key Terms and Definitions**  
- **Azure RBAC** â€“ A security system that controls access to Azure resources **based on roles**.  
- **Roles** â€“ A set of **permissions** assigned to a user or group (e.g., **Owner, Reader, Contributor**).  
- **Scope** â€“ The **range of resources** a role applies to (e.g., **Subscription, Resource Group, Individual Resource**).  
- **Inheritance** â€“ When a **parent scope** has a role, it automatically applies to **all child scopes**.

## **RBAC Example**  

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**  
ðŸ’¡ **Scenario:** You hire a new engineer. Instead of manually assigning them **access to every resource**, you:  
âœ… Add them to the **Azure RBAC group for engineers**.  
âœ… They **automatically** get the **same access** as other engineers.  
âœ… If **new resources** are added, they **inherit permissions** without needing changes.

## **How is Role-Based Access Applied?**  

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**  
ðŸ”¹ **RBAC is applied at a Scope**, which can be:  
   - **Management Group** (multiple subscriptions).  
   - **Subscription** (all resources within).  
   - **Resource Group** (a collection of related resources).  
   - **Single Resource** (an individual VM, storage account, etc.).  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:**  
   - If a **user is assigned "Owner"** at the **Management Group** level, they **control all subscriptions** within it.  
   - If a **group is assigned "Reader"** at the **Subscription** level, all members can **view all resources** but **not edit them**.

## **How is Azure RBAC Enforced?**  

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**  
ðŸ”¹ **Azure RBAC is enforced** through **Azure Resource Manager** (ARM).  
ðŸ”¹ **RBAC only applies to Azure resource management**, **not application security**.  
ðŸ”¹ **RBAC uses an "Allow" model** â€“ If you have multiple roles, **you inherit the highest level of permission**.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**  
   - If **one role grants Read access** to a resource groupâ€¦  
   - And **another role grants Write access** to the same groupâ€¦  
   - The user **has both Read & Write access**.

## **Key Takeaways**  

âœ… **RBAC helps manage permissions efficiently** by assigning **roles instead of individual permissions**.  
âœ… **RBAC applies to different scopes** and follows a **hierarchical structure** (higher levels inherit permissions).  
âœ… **RBAC is enforced through Azure Resource Manager** and **does not** control application-level security.
