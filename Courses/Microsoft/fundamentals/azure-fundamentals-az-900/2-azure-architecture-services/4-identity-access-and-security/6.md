# **Zero Trust Security Model**  

The **Zero Trust** model assumes that **no one and nothing** can be automatically trusted, even inside a secure network. **Every request must be verified** before access is granted.

## **Why is Zero Trust Important?**  

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**  
🔹 **Assumes Breach** – Always **assume attackers are inside the network** and verify every request.  
🔹 **Protects Against Modern Threats** – Traditional security focused on network perimeters; **Zero Trust protects everything, everywhere**.  
🔹 **Works with Remote & Mobile Workforces** – Security is applied **regardless of location**, protecting users, devices, apps, and data.

## **Key Principles of Zero Trust**  

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key Terms and Definitions**  

- **Zero Trust** – A security model that **assumes breach** and requires **verification for every access request**.  
- **Verify Explicitly** – Always authenticate and authorize users **based on all available data**.  
- **Use Least Privilege Access** – Grant only the **minimum access needed** with **Just-In-Time (JIT) & Just-Enough-Access (JEA)** policies.  
- **Assume Breach** – **Minimize risk** by segmenting access, enforcing **end-to-end encryption**, and using analytics for threat detection.

## **How is Zero Trust Different from Traditional Security?**  

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**  
🔹 **Traditional Security Model:**  
   ✅ **Trusts internal devices** – If a device is inside the network, it is considered safe.  
   ✅ **Network perimeters are protected**, but **internal threats** are not well managed.  
   ✅ **Personal devices may be restricted** or blocked.  

🔹 **Zero Trust Security Model:**  
   ✅ **Verifies every request** – No device or user is **automatically trusted**.  
   ✅ **Authentication required** before access is granted.  
   ✅ **Access is granted based on identity and security posture**, not location.

## **How Zero Trust Works in Practice**  

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**  

💡 **Example Scenario:**  
1️⃣ **A user logs in from an unmanaged device.**  
2️⃣ Instead of granting access **just because they are on the network**, Zero Trust **requires full authentication**.  
3️⃣ If authentication is successful, the user **only gets access to what they need** (Least Privilege).  
4️⃣ If there’s any **unusual activity**, security policies **block access or enforce additional verification**.

## **Key Takeaways**  

✅ **Zero Trust = No automatic trust.**  
✅ **Every request is verified before access is granted.**  
✅ **Protects against internal and external threats.**  
✅ **Works everywhere, even for remote users.**
