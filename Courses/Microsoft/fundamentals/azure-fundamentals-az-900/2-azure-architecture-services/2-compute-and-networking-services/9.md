| **Azure DNS Overview**                 | Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. You can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services. | ðŸ”¹ **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A system that translates domain names into IP addresses. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Azure DNS**: A service that hosts DNS domains on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. | ðŸ”¹ **Reliability & Performance**: <br> DNS domains are hosted on Azure's global network of DNS servers, providing: <br> - High availability <br> - Fast performance |
| **Benefits of Azure DNS**              | **Reliability & Performance** <br> **Security** <br> **Ease of Use** <br> **Customizable Virtual Networks** <br> **Alias Records** | ðŸ”¹ **Anycast Networking**: A method where multiple DNS servers respond to queries, selecting the nearest one for faster performance. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: The management framework used for deploying and managing Azure resources. | ðŸ”¹ **Security**: Azure DNS is built on Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and provides: <br> - **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages access to resources. <br> - **Activity Logs**: Tracks user actions for troubleshooting. <br> - **Resource Locking**: Prevents accidental changes or deletions. |
| **Limitations of Azure DNS**           | Azure DNS does not allow you to buy a domain name directly. You can purchase a domain through App Service Domains or a third-party registrar, then host it in Azure DNS for record management. | ðŸ”¹ **App Service Domains**: A service from Azure to buy domain names. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Third-party Domain Registrar**: An external service to buy domain names, e.g., GoDaddy. | ðŸ”¹ **Alias Records**: Use alias records to point to Azure resources (e.g., Azure Public IP, Azure CDN, Azure Traffic Manager) and have them automatically update if the underlying resource's IP changes. <br> ðŸ”¹ **Ease of Use**: Azure DNS integrates with the Azure portal, PowerShell, and CLI, allowing seamless DNS management for both internal and external resources. |
