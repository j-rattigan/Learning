### Responsiblities
| **Cloud Providers** | **Consumersr**| **Examples** |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| -🔒 Physical security <br> -❄️ Power and cooling <br> -🌐 Network connectivity <br> -🏢 The physical data center and network infrastructure | -📂 Data stored in the cloud <br> -🔑 Managing access security (who can access what) <br> -📱 Devices that connect to the cloud (e.g., phones, computers) <br>|-🏢 **Traditional Data Center:** Your IT department maintains everything, but in the cloud, the provider handles infrastructure, while you handle data and access control. <br> -🗄️ **Cloud SQL Database:** The cloud provider maintains the database itself, but the consumer is responsible for the data in the database. <br> -💻 **Virtual Machine (VM):** The consumer installs and maintains the SQL database and its updates, as well as the data within it. |
