- **Cloud Computing**: The delivery of computing services (e.g., storage, virtual machines) over the internet, rather than from physical servers in a data center.
- **IT Infrastructure**: The hardware, software, and network resources needed to support IT services.
- **Virtual Machines**: Software-based emulations of physical computers that run operating systems and applications.

- Cloud services extend beyond traditional IT to include emerging technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- With cloud computing, you can quickly scale up your IT resources without waiting to build a new physical data center. This makes it easier to meet growing demand.
- IoT devices can send data to the cloud, where it can be processed using AI or ML models to make real-time decisions.
