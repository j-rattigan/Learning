### 🔹 App Protection Policies (MAM)

- 🔑 **Key:** App Protection Policies protect company data inside apps — even on personal (unmanaged) devices.
- ❗ **Important:** MAM doesn’t require full device enrollment — great for BYOD.
- 🧩 **Supporting Details:**
  - Features include: data encryption, copy/paste restrictions, app PIN.
  - Selective wipe removes only corporate data.
- 📌 **Example:** A user’s personal phone has Outlook and OneDrive apps managed by Intune — work files are encrypted and protected.
- 💬 **Scenario:** A salesperson leaves the company — Intune wipes only the company email and documents from their phone, not their personal photos.
