### 🔹 What is the Endpoint?

- 🔑 **Key:** An endpoint is any device that connects to your network — desktops, phones, laptops, tablets.
- ❗ **Important:** Endpoints are common entry points for attackers.
- 🧩 **Supporting Details:**
  - Devices have different risk levels based on use case, access, and OS.
  - Unmanaged or outdated devices increase the risk of breaches.
- 📌 **Example:** A home laptop used for remote work is an endpoint and must be secured.
- 💬 **Scenario:** A user brings in their personal iPad to check email — without protection, it’s a potential threat to sensitive data.

### 🔹 Endpoint Management Approach

- 🔑 **Key:** Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) consolidates device and app management into one system.
- ❗ **Important:** UEM helps enforce consistent security and user experience.
- 🧩 **Supporting Details:**
  - Intune supports UEM by managing both apps and devices across platforms.
  - Enables automation, reporting, and policy compliance.
- 📌 **Example:** Intune manages Windows laptops and Android phones from one console.
- 💬 **Scenario:** A company adopts UEM to simplify managing its mixed fleet of employee devices — reducing manual work and improving security.
