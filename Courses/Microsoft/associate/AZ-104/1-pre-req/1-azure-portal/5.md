- **Preview Features**: These are features that are still being developed and are available for users to try out. They may change or be removed in future updates.
- **Activation**: Preview features must be manually enabled in the Azure portal to access them.
- **Updates**: Preview features can receive frequent updates and improvements before they are generally available.
- **Risk**: Since they are in development, preview features might have bugs or incomplete functionality, so they should be used with caution.

- **Beta Testing**: Preview features are essentially beta versions that provide feedback for Microsoft to improve before full release.
- **Opt-In**: Users must opt-in to use preview features, meaning they are not enabled by default.
- **Documentation**: Preview features are often accompanied by documentation that highlights their potential use cases and known issues.

- **How to Enable**: To enable preview features, go to the Azure portal settings, select "Preview features," and toggle on the desired features.
- **Testing New Tools**: Users can leverage preview features to test new tools and services before they become generally available, allowing for early adoption.
- **Feedback**: Microsoft encourages users to provide feedback on the preview features, which helps improve the product.
- **Not Production-Ready**: As preview features are not fully stable, they are generally not recommended for use in production environments.

## 🔍 2. Summary
Preview features in Azure provide early access to new capabilities, but they are not fully stable and may change as they are refined.

## 🔥 3. Analogy
Think of preview features like trying out a beta version of a game—you're getting to experience it early, but there might be bugs or things that don’t work perfectly.
